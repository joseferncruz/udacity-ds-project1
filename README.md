## Introduction

**New York City** is well known for the excellent cultural and gastronomical scene. When the pandemic hit, some restaurants were forced to close and others started to provide outdoor dinning under [Phase Two of the Stateâ€™s New York Forward Plan](). The measure became very popular and provided the opportunity to sustain the recover of the business and attract new costumers with better social distancing conditions. Using the dataset provided by NYC, I wanted to understand:

1. Which borough and neighborhoods contains the highest amount of restaurants with outdoor dinning available?

2. Where is located the highest amount of restaurants in close proximity to a landmark building or location?

3. What is the proportion of restaurants providing outdoor dinning that offer alcoholic beverages in the neighborhood with the highest density of landmark locations?

## The data

The dataset is publicly available through the [New York City Open Data Initiative](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Open-Restaurant-Applications/pitm-atqc). The version available in the directory `dataset/` was downloaded on April 9th, 2021.

In order to generate choropleth maps, I downloaded a [geojson](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods) containing the geographic limits of the [NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nynta.page). The geojson file can be found in the directory `dataset/`.


## Installation

In order to view the code of this project, you can use of options:

__A)__ Run the code in a local machine:

1. Download or clone this repository using git on bash:
```
$ git clone ...
```
2. Install a python environment with jupyter notebooks/lab such (e.g., [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)).

3. Create an environment with the required packages by running on the anaconda shell:
```
$ conda env create -f ...
```

__B)__ Open the notebook on Binder:

```
add binder
```
